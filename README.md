## Design Brief

This page demonstrates basic JavaScript functionality using a form and a JSON data file. When a user enters a name, the script searches a local JSON file and displays matching information like age and job. This task showcases DOM manipulation, event handling, and data fetching using JavaScript.
 Example names to test: Alice, Bob, Zareef
If a name isn’t in the data, the site will show “No person found” — this is part of the expected behavior.
